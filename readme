I have used the DNSPython API and libraries like 
DNS.query
DNS.resolver
DNS.name
DNS.rcode
DNS.message
DNS.opcode
DNS.flags
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Program has DNS Resolver which iteratively resolves the authority server of the domain name requested by the user in the main function.

For Dig implementation the dig first calls the resolver function and obtains the name server and the corresponding resolution of the type is done in the mydig file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run your program:
The folder has two files mydnsresolver.py and mydig.py

The dns resolver works by typing python mydnsresolver.py "<example.com>"on the command prompt and the output shall be printed on the command shell.

The dig file will work using python mydig.py "<example.com>" "<Type>"

Note:
I have Used LTE for testing.
